I have never imagined myself being an accountant. I studied music for entire my life and I thought that was my only way for my future. However, when I started attending KCC, I realized that I like math and that is how I ended up changing my major into accounting.

Since I transferred to Shidler until now, I was confused what to do in my near future. I wanted to be a CPA but without a clear idea. To fulfill 150 credits, I decided to double major in Management Information Systems. One of my friends who is working in accounting field, recommended me to learn this major. Actually, I am interested what we are learning now. Hopefully, this can open up my future pathways to better jobs. 

I cannot say that I am really IT person, but I can say that I like learning. I will try to do my best to learn as much as possible in this class.
